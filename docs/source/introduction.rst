Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation for the XMARTe interface - a graphical user interface for configuring, simulating, and compiling MARTe2 applications using block-based programming.

Users are assumed to have knowledge of MARTe2 prior to developing with XMARTe.

The application is designed to abstract the complexity of text-based configuration files by enabling the user to define and manage MARTe2 applications graphically.

To use configuration files after generating them from XMARTe, you will need to compile `MARTe2 <https://github.com/aneto0/MARTe2>`_ and `MARTe2-components <https://github.com/aneto0/MARTe2-components>`_.
Instructions on how to set this up can be found `here <https://vcis-gitlab.f4e.europa.eu/aneto/MARTe2-demos-padova/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads#:~:text=Setting%20up%20environment>`_.
